# Express Scaffolding

I don't like default Express scaffolding when one issues an `express my-new-app`, so I'm making one that fits my taste and needs.


## Installation

Clone this repo and remove `.git` directory if you want to get ride of unspecific-to-your-project history.

Edit `package.json` to fill empty strings.

Then run

```
npm install
```

to get starting dependencies.


## Run

- To run it in development mode use
```
npm debug
```
- To run it in production mode use
```
npm start
```
- To run your tests issue
```
npm test
```
But there're no test provided nor test command. You have to provide them.
