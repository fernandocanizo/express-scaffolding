# Express Scaffolding

I don't like default Express scaffolding when one issues an `express my-new-app`, so I'm making one that fits my taste and needs.


## Installation

Clone this repo and remove `.git` directory if you want to get ride of unspecific-to-your-project history.

Edit `package.json` to fill empty strings.

Then run

```
npm install
```

to get starting dependencies.


## Run

```
npm start
```
